[[overview]]
== Overview

As with pod environment variables, build environment variables can be defined in
terms of references to other resources/variables using the xref:../../dev_guide/downward_api.adoc#dev-guide-downward-api[Downward API].
However, there are some exceptions as noted below.

[NOTE]
====
You can also manage environment variables defined in the `BuildConfig` with the
xref:../../dev_guide/environment_variables.adoc#dev-guide-environment-variables[`oc set env`] command.

<1> the value should be resolved using the following references
<2> the following `fieldPath` refers to a jsonpath in the `build`
<3> the jsonpath to the field in the `build`

== Using Container Resources as Environment Variables

Referencing container resources using valueFrom in build environment variables is not supported
as the references are resolved before the container is created.
