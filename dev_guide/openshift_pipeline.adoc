[[overview]]

== Overview

OpenShift Pipelines give you fine-grained control over building, deploying, and promoting your applications on OpenShift.
Using a combination of the Jenkins Pipeline Build Strategy, Jenkinsfiles, and the OpenShift DSL _(provided by the OpenShift
Jenkins Client Plugin)_, you can create advanced build/test/deploy/promote Pipelines for any scenario.

[[openshift-jenkins-Pipeline-plugin]]

== OpenShift Jenkins Client Plugin

The https://github.com/openshift/jenkins-client-plugin[OpenShift Jenkins Client Plugin] must be installed
on your Jenkins master so that the OpenShift DSL will be available to use within the JenkinsFile for your
application.  This plugin is installed and enabled by default when using the OpenShift Jenkins image.

For more information about installing and configuring this plugin, see xref:../install_config/configuring_pipeline_execution.html#openshift-pipeline-dsl-plugin[Installation and Configuration - Configuring Pipeline Execution].

[[the-openshift-dsl]]

=== OpenShift DSL

The OpenShift Jenkins Client Plugin provides a fluent-styled Domain Specific Language (DSL) for communicating with the OpenShift
API from within the Jenkins slaves.  The OpenShift DSL is based on Groovy syntax and provides many convenience
methods for controlling the lifecycle of your application such as Create, Build, Deploy, and Delete to name a few.

The full details of the API are embedded within the plugin's online documentation within a running Jenkins instance. To find it:

* Create a new Pipeline Item
* Click "Pipeline Syntax" below the DSL text area
* On the left navigation menu, click "Global Variables Reference"


[[jenkins-pipeline-strategy]]

== Jenkins Pipeline Strategy

In order to take advantage of the OpenShift Pipelines within your project, you will need to utilize the
xref:../../dev_guide/builds/build_strategies.html#pipeline-strategy-options[Jenkins Pipeline Build Strategy].
This strategy defaults to using a *Jenkinsfile* at the root of your source repository, but also provides the
following configuration options:

* an inline jenkinsFile field within your BuildConfig
* a jenkinsfilePath field within your BuildConfig that references the location of the JenkinsFile to use relative to the source contextDir.

[NOTE]
====
The optional *jenkinsfilePath* field specifies the name of the file to use, relative to the source *contextDir*.
If *contextDir* is omitted, it defaults to the root of the repository. If *jenkinsfilePath* is omitted, it defaults to *Jenkinsfile*.
====

For more detailed information about the Jenkins Pipeline Strategy see xref:../../dev_guide/builds/build_strategies.html#pipeline-strategy-options[Pipeline Strategy Options].

[[the-jenkinsfile]]

== Jenkinsfile

The Jenkinsfile utilizes the standard groovy language syntax to allow fine grained control
over the configuration, build, and deployment of your application.

The Jenkinsfile can be supplied in one of the following ways:

- a file located within your source code repository
- embedded as part of your build configuration using the *jenkinsfile* field

When using the first option, the Jenkinsfile must be included in your applications source code repository at one of the following locations:

- A file named *Jenkinsfile* at the root of your repository
- A file named *Jenkinsfile* at the root of the source *contextDir* of your repository
- A file name specified via the *jenkinsfilePath* field of the *JenkinsPiplineStrategy* section of your build config, which is relative to the source *contextDir* if supplied, otherwise it defaults to the root of the repository

The Jenkinsfile is executed on the Jenkins slave pod, which must have the OpenShift Client binaries available if you intend to use the OpenShift DSL.

[[disabling-jenkins-autoprovisioning]]

=== Disabling Jenkins AutoProvisioning

When a Pipeline build configuration is created, OpenShift checks to see if there is currently a Jenkins
master pod provisioned in the current project.  If no Jenkins master is found, one is automatically created.
If this behavior is not desirable (if you would like to use a Jenkins server external to OpenShift, for example),
you can disable it.  See xref:../../install_config/configuring_pipeline_execution.html[Configuring Pipeline Execution] for more information.

[[configuring-slave-pods]]

=== Configuring Slave Pods

The https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Kubernetes+Plugin[Kubernetes Plugin] is also pre-installed in the official Jenkins image. This plugins allows
the Jenkins master to create slave pods on OpenShift and delegate running jobs to them to achieve scalability as well as providing pods with specific
runtimes for specific jobs.

For more detailed information on configuring slave pods using the Kubernetes Plugin see https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin/blob/master/README.md[Kubernetes Plugin README].
